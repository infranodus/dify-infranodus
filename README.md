# Useful InfraNodus Workflows for Dify

A collection of [Dify](https://dify.ai) and [InfraNodus](https://infranodus.com) integrations.


## Workflow Descriptions

You can import a workflow from our definitions provided in the YML files. Simply go to Studio > Import DSL file and use one of the `.yml` files provided here. 

For more help on these worksflows, see our [suppor portal API examples](https://support.noduslabs.com/hc/en-us/sections/18343587412252-AI-RAG-GraphRAG-and-LLM-Workflows)

## Custom Tool Schemas

You can use the JSON files to add new custom tools to your Dify workflows that would query the InfraNodus API endpoints. 

Simply go to Tools > Custom > Add new tool and then paste the JSON to the OpenAI Schema window.

Then when you use the tool in your workflows, you will be able to provide the necessary parameters to make a request. 

Alternatively, you can use the HTTP node in Dify directly to make your API requests to InfraNodus, but in that case you'll have to specify the URL query and POST parameters manually.
